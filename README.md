# Java Native Interface Programming, By Examples

This is an examples repository for Java's JNI. The codes are written in C++ and Java, properly demonstrating the correct way to interact with JNI through tools like `javah` and `javac`. Alternatively, the CMakeLists.txt utilizes CMake to compile the C++ library along with JNI implementations, and the jnihelper.sh shell script provides decent helper utilities to rapidly prototype a JNI library.
